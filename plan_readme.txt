create a Node.js module that precisely replicates the functionality and API of the popular `https://github.com/eggplants/deepl-cli`. A clone of the repo is located here: `00_ProjectsFocus/Translator/eggplants_deepl-cli` . All necessary data and information required (HTML tags and so on..) for scraping the target `Deepl.com` can be found in the repo.
do not use `python`
use `Node.js`
use the Method: `axios` + `cheerio` , do not use `puppeteer` or `Playwright`
use the main directory for implementation `00_ProjectsFocus/Translator` and create necessary folder structure. The folder `00_ProjectsFocus/Translator/eggplants_deepl-cli` is only a source for information and examples that are required for scraping the target.
